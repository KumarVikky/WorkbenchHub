# WorkbenchHub

[WorkbenchHub](https://salesarena-dev-ed.my.site.com/workbenchhub/s/) is the latest project that I have created on Lightning Experience. It is mainly built on LWC & Apex, it can query data & metadata based on various parameters from an authorized Salesforce Organization using Force.com Rest APIs. It also can filter, sort, and download these records. Additionally, it can perform CRUD operations on Salesforce records with CSV data files. Furthermore, it can retrieve & deploy metadata files across different Salesforce environments using Metadata SOAP APIs & Tooling API's. It can also execute Apex code anonymously & capture debug statements using Tooling API's. It can also build and execute any Rest Resouces API's using Rest Reuest Builder.
